# python_mini_projects
Set of python mini programs. Created to refresh and learn skills.

In this repository I keep following programs:
- caesar_cipher (program that encrypts or decrypts a message using Caesar cipher method)
- game_hangman (popular game, you have to guess secret word)
- rock_scissors_paper_lizard_spock (modified version of game paper-rock-scissors)
